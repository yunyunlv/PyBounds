	Attributes
	----------
	vertices : list 
		a list of vertices of the polygon (in any order)
	isSorted : Boolean
		whether the vertices are ordered counter clockwise with the first vertex 
		being the one with the smallest Y coordinate
		(and with smallest X coordinate in case of a tie)

	Methods
	-------
	sort()
		sort the vertices of the polygon counter clockwise such that 
		the first vertex is the one with the smallest Y coordinate
		(and with smallest X coordinate in case of a tie)
	angles()
		sort the vertices of the polygon if it is not sorted
		return the list of polar angles of all edges
		starting with the edge from the first vertex to the second,
		from the second to the third, ...,
		and from the last to the first. 
	plotPolygon()
		plot the polygon, color filled
	scatterPolygon()
		scatter plot the vertices of the polygon
